# ntzfind
Changes so far:

* Faster search (about 1.6X)

* Added support for widths > 10

* Reduced memory consumption (only 19GB needed for width 11 searches)

* Table generation much faster (more than 5x for large tables)

* Table generation dynamic (as needed) rather than up-front

* Rule parsing integrated; no need for separate python script

* Added randomized search order; are you feeling lucky?
